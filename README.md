# LedFader
An Arduino project to control a three color LED stripe

## Hardware
Currently following Hardware is used:

1. NodeMCU 0.9 Contoller
2. IxxA LED Stripe
3. 3 XY-MOS power moduls
4. miscellaneous electronic parts to wire all up

## Software
Ardunino project based on WebServer as UI for the Fader. 3 digital IO Ports as direct PWM source to the XY-MOS.
Perhaps some use of an IR-RemoteControl.
